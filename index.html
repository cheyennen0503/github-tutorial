<a id="git-vs-github" class="anchor" href="#git-vs-github" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git vs. GitHub</h2>

<p>The difference between git and github is that git takes snapshots of code and doesn't need github in order to function but <strong>github needs git</strong>.<br>
Github stores all of your code/snapshots in the cloud or your remote repository</p>

<a id="to-make-a-github-account" class="anchor" href="#to-make-a-github-account" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To make a github account:</h5>

<ol>
<li>first you go to <a href="github.com">github.com</a>.<br>
</li>
<li>Next, you go to the top right of the screen and click "sign up". </li>
<li>Then you fill in the information required. <img src="https://snag.gy/Aykn39.jpg" alt="image">
</li>
<li>Github will then ask you for a plan and you click the free plan and move on to the third step.</li>
<li>The third and final step is optional where github wants to learn more about you and your experience. You can either fill it out or skip this step. </li>
<li>Now when you go to <a href="c9.io">cloud 9</a>, you can easily log in with your github account</li>
<li>
<strong>REMEMBER</strong> to verify your account. an email will be sent from github in order for you to verify you are not a robot, click the link given to verify yourself. if you do not do this, nobody will be able to see any of your remote repositories</li>

<ol>
<li>Go to your workspace in cloud 9 and change directories into your workspace by typing <code>cd ~/workspace</code>.</li>
<li>Next make your directory by typing <code>mkdir "name"</code>.</li>
<li>Then change directories to your new directory by typing <code>cd "name"</code>.</li>
<li>Then type <code>git init</code>. This initializes git into your local repository. <em>Always make sure you are in your local repository</em>. </li>
<li>Next, make a README file by typing <code>touch README.md</code>. The md stands for markdown.</li>
<li>Type what ever you would like in your readme file.</li>
<li>Next, to save this work, you use <code>git add .</code> or <code>git add README.md</code> to add it to the staging area for it to be commited, or taken a snapshot of for it to be saved. </li>
<li>Then you commit what you added by typing <code>git commit -m "(message)"</code>. This takes a snapshot of your changes to your file to be saved in the cloud.</li>

<a id="workflow--commands" class="anchor" href="#workflow--commands" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow &amp; Commands</h2>

<p><em>As you go on with working with your code, you should constantly use these commands to keep track of your code.</em></p>

<h4>
<a id="git-status" class="anchor" href="#git-status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>git status</h4>

<p>Git status is a tool used to see the changes that have been made in your project (the status of your project) which would show up in red and when an edited file has been added to the staging area for a snapshot, it will show up in <code>git status</code> as green. So the syntax of <code>git status</code> is exactly that. You use git status before you add, after you add, and after you commit. You can also use it any other time to see if anything has been recently motified or what's on the staging area just to keep track as you go along.<br>

<h4>
<a id="git-add" class="anchor" href="#git-add" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>git add</h4>

<p>Git add is a tool used to add files to the staging area to be committed. There are many different ways to add. There's <code>git add 'file'</code>, <code>git add .</code>, and <code>git add --all</code>. For <code>git add 'file'</code>, this is a simple way to add a single file that you have recently edited to the staging area to be committed. <code>git add .</code> adds all of the files that have been edited to the staging area. <code>git add --all</code> adds all of the files that have changes including deleted files. </p>

<h4>
<a id="git-commit" class="anchor" href="#git-commit" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>git commit</h4>

<p>Git commit is a tool used for taking snapshots of code that are on the staging area. After you add a file or files and to <code>git status</code>, you simply type in <code>git commit -m</code>. The -m is for you to type a message <strong>in quotations</strong> of what changes you have made in the file or files. It's imperative that you type in the command as shown because if you don't, it can lead you to somewhere you don't want to go.<br>

<h4>
<a id="git-push" class="anchor" href="#git-push" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>git push</h4>

<p>Git push is a tool used to add all of your commits to your remote repository. Your remote repository is your repository in github where all of your code is stored. After you commit your code, you push it to the remote repository by using <code>git push</code>. You use <code>git push</code> after you do <code>git push -u origin master</code> which tells git where the code is being pushed to. You only use it once.<br>

<h4>
<a id="fork" class="anchor" href="#fork" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fork</h4>

<p>Forking is a way to create a replica of someone else's remote repository so that you can take their project, make changes, and push those changes to the forked remote repository without disrupting the original project. When you want to fork a project on github, you simply go to that project and click "fork" on the top right corner. </p>

<h4>
<a id="clone" class="anchor" href="#clone" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clone</h4>

<p>Cloning is when you create a replica of a local repository that has already been made and saved in your own repository. Cloning is good for re-naming your remote repository. When you clone a local repository from a remote, it automatically creates the connection between the remote and local as well as names it and the cloned local repository. To clone, you go to your remote, you click "clone or download", make sure you're cloning with SSH, and copy the link to your clipboard. Then go to your workspace in cloud 9 and type <code>git clone (url)</code> and the repository should show up.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pull-requests" class="anchor" href="#pull-requests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pull Requests</h4>

<p>Pull requests are ways that people who have forked your repository and have made changes to it can let you see those changes and possibly add them to the original project. When you submit a pull request, on your forked repository, you click pull request to suggest those changes. <img src="https://snag.gy/6NzseH.jpg" alt="image"></p>

<h4>
<a id="pull" class="anchor" href="#pull" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pull</h4>

<p>After you accept your pull request suggesting changes to your project, you simply type git pull to see those changes in effect on your orininal project. </p>
